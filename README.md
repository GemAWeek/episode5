# GemAWeek Episode 5 - RABL

RABL (Ruby API Builder Language) was created by Nathan Esquinazi and the
guys at Miso. It provides a way to build a robust, public API in a very
intuitive way. RABL is a templating system for generating JSON and XML
in [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com),
and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).
